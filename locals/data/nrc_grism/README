The files in this directory serve as an example of level-2b processing of a
NIRCam grism (Wide-Field Slitless Spectroscopy) exposure.

The input files consist of the following.

calwebb_spec2.cfg: Level-2b spectroscopic pipeline configuration file

jw111110-a3001_20171109T145456_spec2_001_asn.json: Level-2 Association file,
which specifies the name of the output(s) to be created, the input exposure
(the _rate.fits file below), the name of the input source catalog (the
_cat.ecsv file below), and the type of pipeline to be used.

jw11111001001_01104_00001_nrcalong_rate.fits: The input level-2a exposure.

jw11111001001_01104_00001_nrcalong_cat.ecsv: The input source catalog, created
from level-3 processing of related direct-imaging exposures.


The level-2b pipeline processing is performed using:

$ strun calwebb_spec2.cfg jw111110-a3001_20171109T145456_spec2_001_asn.json


The following output products will be generated.

jw11111001001_01104_00001_nrcalong_cal.fits: The calibrated 2D spectroscopic
data.

jw11111001001_01104_00001_nrcalong_x1d.fits: The 1D extracted spectra.

An example processing log is included in the file "processing_log.txt".
